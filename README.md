# Claude Code Web Studio

An AI-powered virtual web development studio that runs entirely inside **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code)**.

Inspired by [Claude Code Game Studios](https://github.com/Donchitos/Claude-Code-Game-Studios) — same concept, but built for **web application development**.

> Clone this repo, open Claude Code, and you have a full dev team in your terminal — architects, frontend/backend leads, framework specialists, QA engineers, and more.

## What Is This?

This is **not** a web application. It's a **configuration layer** for Claude Code — a collection of markdown agent definitions, skill workflows, hooks, and docs that turn Claude Code into a structured web development environment.

When you open Claude Code in this directory, you get access to:

- **51 AI agents** organized in a 3-tier studio hierarchy
- **50 slash commands** (skills) covering the full development lifecycle
- **Automated hooks** for commit validation and code quality checks
- **MCP catalog** of officially-published vendor servers (Stripe, Sentry, Supabase, GitHub, etc.)
- **Docs & templates** for architecture, APIs, databases, and more

## Supported Technologies

## Typical Workflow

```
1. PLAN       /brainstorm → /define-features → /create-architecture
2. DESIGN     /wireframe → /setup-theme → /design-api → /design-database
3. BUILD      /create-page → /create-component → /create-endpoint
4. INTEGRATE  /setup-auth → /setup-email → /setup-payments → /setup-i18n
5. TEST       /write-tests → /audit-performance → /audit-accessibility
6. RELEASE    /setup-cicd → /build → /deploy
```

Or ask `/help` at any point to see where you are and what to do next.

## Guided Workflow (Orchestration Layer)

The studio is designed to feel like a guided game — you're never left staring at a blank prompt wondering what to run next.

- **Handoff menus** — every skill ends with a numbered "what's next?" block so you can pick the next step by number or stay and chat.
- **MVP anchor** — `/start` and `/brainstorm` write a one-line MVP to `.claude/session/mvp.md`. It shows up in every skill's Status block so the north star is always visible.
- **Session breadcrumbs** — each skill appends a timestamped line to `.claude/session/active.md`, giving you a running log of what's been done.
- **SessionStart hook** — every time you open Claude Code in this directory, the hook surfaces your MVP, review mode, and the last 40 lines of breadcrumbs so context is never lost.
- **Review gates** — pick a mode during `/start`:
  - `solo` — no gates, move fast
  - `lean` — directors review at phase boundaries (architecture, build, deploy)
  - `full` — directors review after every meaningful skill

At phase-boundary skills, the designated director (project-architect, tech-lead, or product-owner) is auto-spawned to review before the handoff. See `.claude/docs/review-gates.md` for the full trigger matrix.

## MCP Integration (Optional)

The studio doesn't pre-wire any [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) servers — that would force Stripe / Supabase / Sentry accounts on everyone. Instead, install only what you use:

```
/setup-mcp stripe          # Stripe — payments, customers, products
/setup-mcp sentry          # Sentry — issues, releases, AI debugging
/setup-mcp supabase        # Supabase — DB queries, Edge Functions
/setup-mcp github          # GitHub — repos, PRs, issues, Actions
/setup-mcp vercel          # Vercel — projects, deployments
/setup-mcp linear          # Linear — issues, projects
```

The full catalog with install commands and auth requirements lives in `.claude/docs/mcp-servers.md`. Most modern MCPs are hosted (OAuth) — zero secrets, just a URL. Once installed, relevant skills (`/setup-payments`, `/setup-monitoring`, `/setup-analytics`, etc.) automatically suggest using the MCP for live queries.

## Vendor AI Rules

Many frameworks now publish AI-targeted resources — `llms.txt` files, official "AI rules" pages, or installable rule packs — that materially improve agent output. Specialists in this studio reference these when relevant:

- **Supabase** — vendor-curated AI prompts for RLS, edge functions, SQL style
- **Stripe** — `building-with-llms` guide + `.md` URL convention on docs
- **Next.js / Vercel** — Agent Skills + react-best-practices rules
- **Angular** — explicit do/don't list at `angular.dev/ai/develop-with-ai`
- **Cloudflare** — per-product `llms-full.txt` (Workers, R2, KV, D1, Agents)
- **Convex** — installable rules via `npx convex ai-files install`
- **shadcn / Nuxt / Svelte / Astro / Auth0 / Clerk / Prisma / Drizzle / TanStack** — `llms.txt` or vendor AI guides

The full index lives in `.claude/docs/ai-rules.md`. Specialist agents (`@supabase-specialist`, `@nextjs-specialist`, `@angular-developer`, etc.) automatically fetch the relevant URL via `WebFetch` before generating non-trivial code.

## Examples

### Build a SaaS with Next.js + Stripe

/setup-payments                # Stripe subscriptions
/setup-email                   # Transactional emails with Resend
/setup-redis                   # Caching and rate limiting
```

### Build a REST API with Go
```
/start my-api
@go-developer Set up a Gin API with clean architecture
/design-api                    # Define endpoints
/design-database               # Design schema
/create-middleware auth         # JWT auth middleware
/setup-redis                   # Response caching
```

### Build a content site with Astro
```
/start my-blog
@astro-developer Set up Astro with content collections
/setup-seo                     # SEO optimization
/setup-i18n en,tr              # Multilingual support
/setup-analytics               # Privacy-friendly analytics
```

## How It Works

This project uses Claude Code's built-in features:

- **Agents** (`.claude/agents/*.md`) — Each markdown file defines an AI agent with a specific role, expertise, model tier, and allowed tools. Claude Code loads these automatically.
- **Skills** (`.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`) — Each skill is a slash command that guides Claude through a structured workflow. Type `/skill-name` to run one.
- **Hooks** (`.claude/hooks/*.sh`) — Bash scripts that run automatically on certain events (before commits, after file edits) to enforce quality standards.
- **Settings** (`.claude/settings.json`) — Permissions, denied commands, and hook configuration.

No custom runtime, no API keys needed, no server to run. It's just configuration that makes Claude Code smarter about web development.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome:

- Add new agents for frameworks or tools you use
- Create new skills for workflows you need
- Improve existing agent prompts with better expertise
- Add more hooks for quality enforcement
- Report issues or suggest features
